                    Hello! I’m a dedicated web developer with 7.5 years of professional experience, currently working for a multinational company (MNC). I specialize in backend development and have solid knowledge of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                   <br>
                    I bring hands-on experience in AWS Cloud, Unix, Shell Scripting, and PL/SQL. My curiosity and passion for learning have also led me to explore Google Cloud technologies.
Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, learning German, experimenting with DIY projects, trying out new recipes, and unwinding with a good cup of tea.
